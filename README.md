Classic game developed in Python just for fun.



## Usage

- Open a new terminal
- Run the game by typing	`python cli.py [rows] [cols] [bombs]`	, where:
- rows:	number of rows in the field
  - cols:  	number of columns in the field
  - bombs:    number of bombs to be put
- Commands are inserted through the	 `Action: ` 	prompt
  - `E [row] [col]`	exposes the inserted tile (starting from 0)
  - `M [row] [col]`	marks the selected tile
  - `q` or `quit` or `exit` to close the game at any moment
- Have fun?
  - Difficult with that interface, will create a better one for sure!



## Features

- Customizable field size and bomb number
- Command line interface
  - Nasty and painful, perfect for debugging



## Coming soon

- Kivy interface (thank God)
- Winner Winner Sweeper Dinner
